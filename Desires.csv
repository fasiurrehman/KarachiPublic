It's upsetting that notions of class so heavily govern who can and cannot access the beach. I was a student at SZABIST and would often be scoffed at for wanting to go to sea view for 3 hours class breaks and instead folks would want to book beach huts away from the city and visit the sea once in a few months instead of building a living, healthy, personal connection to the beach right beside their houses/uni. I understand that sewerage water is a HUGE part of why people dont want to acess teh beach and thats valid. City governance is the issue. we have little say in how sewerage is constructed and managed so that should be fixed for all. Especially folks who cannot afford to book beach huts away from the city.
