I understand that sewerage water is a HUGE part of why people dont want to acess teh beach and thats valid.

The beach view we enjoyed  while driving by 12+ years ago is no longer there; land reclamation has pushed the sea farther, and the half wall has been raised higher to conceal it.

I understand I don’t look like the general public here, I don’t dress like them, I wouldn’t go there for the same reasons they would.

All this needs to stop (this will be long term, because the sewage will have to be cleaned via processing facilities but as it stands it is harmful to both humans and marine life and alternative forests of mangroves must be planted and the developers stopped from taking over the natural resources and land of the beach). The city government needs to do more than build concrete monuments that are difficult to maintain and run. People who visit must be incentivised to not litter since it also causes death of marine life.

Sandspit,Hawkesbay all need to be cleaned and actively promoted as tourist areas of international standard!.
Green areas/Palm trees etc need to be installed.
Investment in tourist/vacation resorts need to happen in rest of Karachi coast near Hawkesbay,Paradise point,Gidani. There is not enough space on clifton beach and land is very expensive,therefore rest of the coast toward hub/gidani should be opened up to attract investment. Not to buy houses/condos but to built vacation resorts with full amenities.
There are plenty of investors waiting to invest in schemes like that ..but unfortunately due to poor Sindh politics of Karachi for last 35 years..no progress has happened in one of the greatest cities of Pakistan. All investment has happened in Punjab,Lahore,islamabad  and Larkana due to favoritism of Political parties, again ignoring Karachi.
Karachi needs to be developed at the level of other Major cities like Bombay, Singapore,New york etc. It needs a Mass transit system.
